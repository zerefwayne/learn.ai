#### Making machine learning education easy and accessible for all.

### About

The main focus of this web app is to demystify the concepts of machine learning for high-school students or any newcomers. Concepts are laid out in a very user-friendly manner coupled with interactive exercises.

The exercises approach the construction of ML models or neural networks in a "no-code" fashion, where one just has to put in the appropriate building "blocks" to make the entire working model.
